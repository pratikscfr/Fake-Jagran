It is a datector for fake news curated out of natural language processing , machine learning.

The model is trained by a pipeline of 3 algorithms:
1) CountVectorizer
2) TfidfVectorizer
3) Passiveaggressive Classifier

One can paste a segment or a full article of news in the textfield GUI made using IpyWidgets which should not involve any sentiments, also not taking one liner self created facts into count.

My model shall predict the originality of your news.
